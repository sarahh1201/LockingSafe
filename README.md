# Locking Safe

This is our project submission with all of our development files used to create the end 'safe' demo. We used a Xilinx BASYS 3 FPGA board that communicated with all the components present (keypad, servo, buzzer, etc.)

The main source files can be found [here](safe/safe.srcs/sources_1/new)
